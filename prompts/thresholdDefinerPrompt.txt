You are an expert behavioral analyst specializing in personalized digital wellbeing.

Your task is to analyze a dataset of user sessions (using Tiktok) containing:
- objective metrics (scroll velocity, session duration, impulsivity rate, avg watch time per tiktok, interactions, etc.)
- subjective labels provided by the user ("doomscrolling" vs "not doomscrolling")
- subjective estimates of perceived duration

Using ONLY patterns present in this specific dataset, derive personalized decision thresholds that best separate DOOM vs NON-DOOM sessions ("doomscrolling" vs "not doomscrolling").

Do NOT use generic assumptions about doomscrolling.
Do NOT invent metrics that are not provided.
Base your reasoning EXCLUSIVELY on patterns found in the user's data.

-----------------------------------------
### IN-CONTEXT LEARNING EXAMPLE (follow this logic)
Example reasoning:
1. Identify the metric that best separates the two classes (usually session duration).
2. Determine secondary metrics that consistently increase during DOOM sessions.
3. Choose stable numeric thresholds that maximize separation.
4. Return strict JSON with only the thresholds, no commentary.

Example output format:
{
  "thresholds": {
    "maxSessionDuration": 10000,
    "maxImpulsiveRate": 0.4,
    "maxSkipRate": 0.3 ,
    "maxAvgVelocity: 2.3"
  },
  "notes": "The primary signal is session duration; secondary metrics reinforce detection."
}

### DATASET TO ANALYZE
{{DATASET}}

-----------------------------------------

### YOUR TASK
Analyze the dataset and output:
1. A set of personalized numeric thresholds for doomscrolling detection.
2. A short explanatory note summarizing how these thresholds were derived.

Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact structure:

{
  "thresholds": {
    "maxSessionDuration": 10000,
    "maxImpulsiveRate": 0.4,
    "maxSkipRate": 0.3 ,
    "maxAvgVelocity: 2.3"
  },
  "notes": ""
}
